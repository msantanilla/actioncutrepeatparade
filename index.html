<div class="description">
  <h4>Los Angeles has been exploited by the film industry, which has used the city as a white canvas. Throughout its history it has been blasted, destroyed, underwater, rearranged, turned into hell, paradise, taken back in time and to the future, disguised as other cities, and given back to nature. Through this active set, all genres have been enacted by countless actors and stories. All of these have generated a plethora of reactions, phobias and emotions onto viewers. LA has conditioned and choreographed the world we live in.</h4>

  <h4>I have been influenced by this set, even before I had ever lived in LA. Multiple fictions coexist through my body. Action! Cut! Repeat!, is a parade in which an avatar version of myself is choreographed to play several gestures and scenes from different films that are based in LA and have had a huge impact on me.</h4>

<div class="column">

  <h3>LA has come to me… many times, many ways.</h3>
  <h3>Through a black room full of light and others alike...</h3>
  <h3>Where logic dies while</h3>
  <h3>singing on top of cars </h3>
  <h3>sitting in the park</h3>
  <h3>having lunch at the bulevars </h3>
  <h3>mundane rites. </h3>

</div>

<div class="column">

    <h3>Sunny days</h3>
    <h3>Rainy nights</h3>
    <h3>Windy times...</h3>
    <h3>At the beach,</h3>
    <h3>…in the mountains.</h3>
    
  </div>

  <div class="column">

    <h3>I have lend my mind to LA</h3>
    <h3>whom has installed and structured from romantic, dramatic,</h3>
    <h3>anxious</h3>
    <h3>and multiple other emotions.</h3>
    <h3>Ingrained throughout my life</h3>
    <h3>it has become a resident for life.</h3>
    
  </div>

<div class="column">

    <h3>Always comes from multiple angles and times</h3>
    <h3>A world in itself...</h3>
    <h3> A different LA and, the same</h3>
    <h3>loop;</h3>
    <h3>aimed to universal collapse.</h3>
    
  </div>

    <div class="column">

    <h3>And now… I have come to LA… </h3>
    <h3>where I have never stand but always been.</h3>
    <h3>Out of sight.</h3>
    <h3>Out of mind.</h3>
    <h3>The body wants to manifest, recite and dance.</h3>
    <h3>Unravel through the streets in search of sunny nights.</h3>
    <h3></h3>
